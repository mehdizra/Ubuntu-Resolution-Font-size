# VirtualBox Ubuntu Resolution & Font size Problem
### Resolution
Whenever we start a Linux server in Oracle VirtualBox, the console and font size often appear very small. This is largely due to advancements in graphics hardware. After searching for a solution to this issue, I realized it’s not easily accessible or straightforward to find. That’s why I’m sharing it here. You can manually adjust the settings as outlined in the provided guide, or automate the process using the script included in this repository.

**If you're working directly on the server console without using third-party tools or SSH, this guide will be especially helpful.**
